# ViaHitbox
As a result of player hitbox changes in the versions 1.9 and 1.14, you will run into this problem when using ViaVersion on a server lower than 1.14.

PvP servers are probably affected the worst: Players will get stuck when being hit whilst standing under a block, 
resulting in them not receiving any knockback and bugging back again.

This plugin offers you the options to
* A - fix hitboxes for 1.9-1.13 players on 1.8 servers
* B - fix hitboxes for 1.14+ players on a server lower than 1.14

Though there is a catch to the second option (which is why it is configurable separately) - 1.14+ players will be able to go under entrances with a hight of 1.5 blocks (as that is the new hight of their hitbox).
